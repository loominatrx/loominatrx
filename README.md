### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mas Gading. People on the Internet know me as [loominatrx](https://www.roblox.com/users/1565283543/profile).
I'm a teenager, a Roblox game developer, a gamer, and also a [6 digit osu! player](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/loominatrx). I do some Lua(u) and Javascript programming (I'm no expert at both of them), and also I do UI Design on Roblox & Figma (kinda experienced, but bad at picking colors).

If you want to know more about me, check out this cool carrd profile that I made!<br/>https://loominatrx.carrd.co
